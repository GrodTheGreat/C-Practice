# C-Practice
This repo is a place to store some projects as I practice C

## Projects
### 1. **Hello World**

**Overview:** Your first program. It will print "Hello, World!" to the console.

**Skills Focus:** Basic syntax, compiling and running a C program, understanding `printf`.

**Technologies/Frameworks:** GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

### 2. **Simple Calculator**

**Overview:** Create a console-based calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

**Skills Focus:** Basic input/output, arithmetic operations, control structures (if-else, switch-case), loops.

**Technologies/Frameworks:** GCC, standard input/output library (`stdio.h`).

### 3. **Guess the Number Game**

**Overview:** Develop a game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.

**Skills Focus:** Random number generation, loops, conditionals, basic logic implementation.

**Technologies/Frameworks:** `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h` (for `rand()`), time library (for seeding the random number generator).

### 4. **Basic File I/O**

**Overview:** Write a program that reads from a text file and prints its contents to the console. Then modify it to write user input to a text file.

**Skills Focus:** File operations (open, read, write, close), error handling.

**Technologies/Frameworks:** `stdio.h` (for file I/O functions like `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `fclose`).

### 5. **Student Grade System**

**Overview:** Create a program to manage student grades. It should allow adding students, recording their grades, and displaying average grades.

**Skills Focus:** Structs (to store student data), arrays, loops, functions.

**Technologies/Frameworks:** `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`.

### 6. **Linked List Implementation**

**Overview:** Implement a singly linked list with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

**Skills Focus:** Pointers, dynamic memory allocation, data structures (linked list).

**Technologies/Frameworks:** `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`.

### 7. **Simple Text Editor**

**Overview:** Develop a basic text editor that allows users to create, open, edit, and save text files.

**Skills Focus:** Advanced file I/O, string manipulation, dynamic memory management, user interface in the console.

**Technologies/Frameworks:** `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, possibly `ncurses` for enhanced console UI.

### 8. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

**Overview:** Create a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. Optionally, add a simple AI for single-player mode.

**Skills Focus:** Multi-dimensional arrays, game logic implementation, user input handling.

**Technologies/Frameworks:** `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`.

### 9. **HTTP Server**

**Overview:** Build a basic HTTP server that can serve static HTML files.

**Skills Focus:** Network programming (sockets), multi-threading, handling HTTP requests and responses.

**Technologies/Frameworks:** `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, `sys/socket.h`, `netinet/in.h`, `unistd.h`.

### 10. **Database Management System (Mini DBMS)**

**Overview:** Develop a mini database management system that supports basic SQL-like queries to create, read, update, and delete records.

**Skills Focus:** Advanced file handling, parsing user input, implementing data structures (like B-trees), error handling, complex logic implementation.

**Technologies/Frameworks:** `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, data structure libraries.

### Tips for Progression:

1. **Start Small:** Ensure you understand the basic syntax and operations before moving on to more complex tasks.
2. **Documentation:** Always refer to the official C documentation and standard library references.
3. **Version Control:** Use Git for version control from the start, even for simple projects.
4. **Code Reviews:** If possible, get feedback on your code from more experienced developers.
5. **Debugging:** Learn to use debugging tools like `gdb` early in your journey.
6. **Learning Resources:** Use books like "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie, and online resources like tutorials and forums.
